                    <p>The Linux User Group of Mauritius is one of the few Linux User Groups in the Republic of
                        Mauritius, quite possibly the only active one. We are registered with the Registrar of
                        Associations under the name "Linux User Group Meta" since 2009.</p>
                    <p>We all share a common interest, Linux, GNU and Free Software. The LUGM is open to all those in
                        Mauritius who are curious about Linux, users of Linux (new or seasoned) and lovers of free
                        software/open source in general.</p>
